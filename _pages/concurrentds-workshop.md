**Date**: Jan 26-30, 2026

**Location**: NYU Tandon

We organized a collaborative workshop on concurrent data structures. Unlike traditional workshops, this event featured no talks; instead, participants worked together in intense sessions to tackle a collection of research problems.

The workshop kicked off with a tutorial session recapping the project's motivation and research plan, followed by daily working sessions throughout the rest of the week.
