We are organizing a **collaborative workshop on concurrent data structures** during **Jan 26-30, 2026**, at **NYU Tandon**. During the workshop, we will work together on a rich collection of open questions on the concurrent data structure project; there will be no talks.

Participation is by invitation only. If you are invited, please register an account at [MIT coauthor server](https://coauthor.csail.mit.edu/) and send me your username. We will use this platform to share open questions and progress.

## Schedule

Working sessions during 10:00--12:00 and 2:30--5:30 from Monday to Friday.

Monday's morning session starts with a **tutorial session** to recap the project's motivation and research plan.
